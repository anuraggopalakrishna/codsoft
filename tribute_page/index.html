            <h2> The man who saved the Internet </h2>
            <p id="content"> Rinku Dabang was having a normal day when the Internet Database in the Rashtrapati Bhavan
                got an email from famed terrorist Emraan Hashomi. The email threatened to blow up the Indian Internet
                Connection System if Rs 10 billion were not transferred to the terrorist's crypto wallet.

                It fell to R&AW agent Rinku, who got on his Bajaj Discover and rode all the way from Jaipur to Delhi in
                45 minutes. He entered the Rashtrapati Bhavan on his own and curtailed the terrorist's crypto wallet,
                thereby saving the Internet from the clutches of Emraan Hashomi. For this he was awarded the
                presidential Medal of Valor.
